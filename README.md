# Go Mike Designs - Website Optimization Project  

This project was developed as part of my studies at **OpenClassrooms**.  
The goal was to perform a full **SEO, performance, and accessibility audit** on an existing portfolio website for a freelance web designer and apply improvements based on industry standards.

## üìñ Project Overview

The project involved:  
- Running an **audit** of the existing site (SEO, accessibility, performance).  
- Proposing **at least 10 recommended actions** with references and explanations.  
- Applying the improvements directly in the source code.  
- Validating the code using **W3C HTML and CSS validators**.  
- Demonstrating improvements with a **before-and-after Lighthouse comparison**.
